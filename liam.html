<br><p>Liam James Payne is an English singer and songwriter. Payne made his debut as a singer in 2008 when he auditioned for the British television series The X Factor. 
After being eliminated in the competition, he auditioned again in 2010 and was put into a group with four other contestants to form One Direction. 
Payne worked with other producers under the monikers "Big Payno" and "Payno" creating remixes for songs by his group and Cheryl.<br>
After One Direction's hiatus, Payne signed a recording deal with Republic Records in North America.In May 2017, Payne released "Strip That Down" as the lead single from his debut album. It peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart and number ten on the US Billboard Hot 100, being certified platinum in both countries. His debut album, LP1, was released in December 2019.
 He has sold over 18 million singles in just two years since One Direction and over 3.9 billion career streams in that span.<br>
In January 2018, Payne and Rita Ora released the single "For You" from the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Freed. In April 2018, Payne released "Familiar" with J Balvin. He announced his debut album would be released on 14 September 2018. He became the first global brand ambassador for German brand Hugo Boss.
<br>Payne went on to write songs for the group, contributing to two-thirds of their 2014 album Four (arguably their best) and even earning a production credit on 2015’s Made in the AM. But in the early days he would be the one to sing the opening part because, he was told at the time, he “used to settle everybody”.</p>
